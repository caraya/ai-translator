# Starting Prompt

Create a web component that takes the content of an HTML element (passed as the component's attribute) and translates it to a target language selected from a select dropdown by the user.

In chrome, when the appropriate flags are enabled, use the built-in language detection translation features. Otherwise, use a library from transfromers.js (with and without GPU support) to perform the translation.

Show me your model selection process and the reasoning behind it.

Use the following pages as references for building the web component:

* <https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in-apis#translator_api>
* <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Translator_and_Language_Detector_APIs>

and

* <https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/language-detection>

to detect the language of the input text.

Display the translated content inside the web component.
